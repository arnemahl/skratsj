# Skratsj

An online CV created with [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

My CV is hosted at [skratsj.com](https://skratsj.com) and [skrætsj.no](https://skrætsj.no) using [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/).


## Make one yourself

To create your own online CV from Skratsj (for free), here's one way to get started:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run the web app in the client directory (see [client/README.md](./client/README.md)).
3. Bootstrap a Sanity project (see [sanity/README.md](./sanity/README.md)).
4. Host the web app online, using e.g. [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/).
